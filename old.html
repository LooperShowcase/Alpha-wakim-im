      Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes
      ˈmesi] ⓘ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who
      plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter
      Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the
      greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or
      awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best
      player for a record eight times by FIFA.[note 2] Until leaving the club in
      2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he
      won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa
      del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his
      country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A
      prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for
      most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA
      Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa
      América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American
      male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and
      country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672). Messi
      relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he
      made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself
      as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his
      first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the
      first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first
      Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four
      consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award
      four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European
      records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing
      himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons,
      Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his
      perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15
      campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading
      Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth
      Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won
      a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French
      club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club
      and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July
      2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August of that year.
