      Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of
      high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in 1909 in the
      then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial
      designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty and
      numerous race victories. Famous Bugatti automobiles include the Type 35
      Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", the Type 57 "Atlantic" and the Type
      55 sports car. The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be a severe
      blow to the marque, and the death of his son Jean in 1939 meant that there
      was no successor to lead the factory with no more than about 8,000 cars
      made. The company struggled financially, and it released one last model in
      the 1950s before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts
      business in 1963. In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand name
      and revived it as Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.

      During the war Ettore Bugatti was sent away, initially to Milan and later
      to Paris, but as soon as hostilities had been concluded he returned to his
      factory at Molsheim.[2] Less than four months after the Versailles Treaty
      formalised the transfer of Alsace from Germany to France, Bugatti was able
      to obtain, at the last minute, a stand at the 15th Paris motor show in
      October 1919.[2] He exhibited three light cars, all of them closely based
      on their pre-war equivalents, and each fitted with the same overhead
      camshaft 4-cylinder 1,368cc engine with four valves per cylinder.[2]
      Smallest of the three was a "Type 13" with a racing body (constructed by
      the Bugatti themselves) and using a chassis with a 2,000 mm (78.7 in)
      wheelbase.[2] The others were a "Type 22" and a "Type 23" with wheelbases
      of 2,250 and 2,400 mm (88.6 and 94.5 in) respectively.[2]
