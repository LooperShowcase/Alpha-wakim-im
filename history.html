      <h1>The history of Bugatti</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      The company was founded in 1998 as a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group
      and is based in Molsheim, Alsace, France. The original Bugatti automobile
      brand was established by Ettore Bugatti (1881–1947) in 1909 at Molsheim
      and built sports, racing and luxury cars. Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S.
      Subsidiary (S.A.S.)

      In November 2021, the company became part of Bugatti Rimac, a joint
      venture between Rimac Group and Porsche AG.[3] Since November 1, 2021, the
      company has been led by Mate Rimac as chief executive officer of Bugatti
      Rimac.

      On December 22, 1998, Volkswagen AG, a German automotive manufacturer now
      controlled by Porsche SE, established Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. as a
      French-registered, wholly-owned subsidiary. On the same day, the company
      took over the design and naming rights to Bugatti from Italian businessman
      Romano Artioli, who built supercars (such as the EB 110 and EB 112) with
      Bugatti SpA in Italy between 1987 and 1998. Since 2000, the Bugatti
      automobile brand has officially existed as Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S.,
      still abbreviated to Bugatti. Since then, the company's headquarters have
      once again been located in Molsheim, France.

      On 22 December 2000, Volkswagen officially incorporated Bugatti
      Automobiles S.A.S., with former VW drivetrain chief Karl-Heinz Neumann as
      president. The company purchased the 1856 Château Saint-Jean, formerly
      Ettore Bugatti's guest house in Dorlisheim, near Molsheim, and began
      refurbishing it to serve as the company's headquarters. The original
      factory was still in the hands of Snecma, who were unwilling to part with
      it. At the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August 2000, VW announced
      that they would instead build a new modern atelier (factory) next to and
      south of the château. The atelier was officially inaugurated on 3
      September 2005.

      In September 2020, it was announced that Volkswagen was preparing to sell
      its Bugatti automobile brand, and talks began with the Croatian company
      Rimac Automobili. Around 700 Bugatti cars had been sold since 2005, but
      Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess saw the unprofitable brand as ballast,
      the company said.
