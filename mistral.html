      The Bugatti Mistral, also called the Bugatti W16 Mistral, is a mid-engine
      two-seater sports car manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French
      automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. It was revealed on 19
      August 2022.[5] The Mistral is marketed as the fastest roadster in the
      world.[6] Deliveries to customers will begin in early 2024.[7] All 99
      units were pre-sold at a price of 5 million euros.[8]

      The exterior design is unique to the Mistral and is not based on the
      Chiron or the latest Bugatti models. It is very aerodynamic and sporty but
      also luxurious, the front headlights are uniquely designed with four
      diagonal lighting strips, the rear lights are designed as two arrows
      pointing to the Bugatti symbol which is also part of the lighting.
      Compared to the exterior, the passenger cabin was based on the Chiron,
      except for the gear lever design where the "dancing elephant" sculpture
      was embedded in amber, designed by sculptor Rembrandt Bugatti, brother of
      Ettore Bugatti, the founder of Bugatti
